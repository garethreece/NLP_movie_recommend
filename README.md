# NLP_movie_recommend
Simulated movie recommendation based on synopsis information in 'movie.txt' file
# Explaination
An example program that reads the information in the 'movie.txt' file about current movies and compares it to the last movie watched.
Using NLP and the spaCy module for comparing texts, the program analyses the synopsis text for the latest movie in this case 'Hulk', calculates the similarities of the synopsis text in the movie.txt file, and then picks a recommended movie with the highest similarity score that is in the movie.txt file.
The text data can be changed to analyse different movies if required. This program is more of a proof of work to test SpaCy and NPL calculations.
